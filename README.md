## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are simply Large Language Models that have been given the ability to interact with the outside world. They
can do things like draft emails, book appointments in your CRM, create tasks in your task management software, and
really anything you can dream of! I hope that everything I show here can really help you dream big
and create incredible things with AI!

How to use

```bash
python -m venv ai-agents

# On Windows:
.\ai-agents\Scripts\activate

# On MacOS/Linux: 
source ai-agents-masterclass/bin/activate

cd n8n-streamlit-agent (or whichever folder)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can execute the code in the folder with:

```bash
python [script name].py
```
